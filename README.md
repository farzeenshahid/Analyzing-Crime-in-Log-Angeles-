# Analyzing-Crime-in-Log-Angeles-
## Overview

This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles to identify patterns in criminal behavior and assist the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)** in resource allocation.

## Data Source

The dataset is a modified version of publicly available data from **Los Angeles Open Data**, including attributes such as crime occurrence time, victim age, and crime location.

## Key Insights

- **Peak Crime Hours:** Identified the hour with the highest crime frequency.

- **Night Crime Hotspots:** Determined the top crime locations between 10 PM and 4 AM.

- **Victim Age Analysis:** Categorized victims by age groups to study crime impact.

## Future Work

- Analyze crime trends over multiple years.

- Investigate crime types and their location-based distribution.

- Implement predictive models for crime hotspots.

This project provides actionable insights to enhance law enforcement strategies and public safety.
